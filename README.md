# Squall V3 Frontend 

## About

Squall is a content sharing and creation platform for independent musicians. The focus is on creating audiovisual experiences to promote your work via our WebGL-driven, in-browser customizable visualizers. At this iteration, Squall is still a demanding and constantly improving platform, but the goal is to create experiences that are accessible, lightweight, and can reach fans through social media, sharing, and fans keeping an eye on Squall itself.

## Usage

Both the backend and the frontend must be deployed, and pointed to each other.
